# Greg's Learning Notes
This Markdown text doc is where I am keeping all of my notes about this course and any shortcuts or leanings I have figured out!
## Launching the Quiz engine.
Navigate to the Quiz-app folder and launch terminal from that folder and run in terminal
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint

### That should result in a prompt to launch the website of the questions. you can check the ports in terminal to get the link to open in a browser. I think the commands need to be run from the src dir but might try runing at the top dir of the quiz dir to see if it makes a difference. running from the src dir does work though.
